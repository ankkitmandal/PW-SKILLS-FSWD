Q2.Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document?

1.In HTML comments are used to write content, which don't get rendered in web browser. 
2.We use comments to write notes about a code/program so that we could refer that later & it won't hamper our code.
3.Comments are annotated as <!--  --> .Example <!-- Note-save html file with .html-->
