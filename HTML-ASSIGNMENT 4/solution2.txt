HTML entities are special codes or character references used in HTML to display characters and symbols
 that have a reserved or special meaning in HTML or may not display correctly in the browser. Here are 
 five commonly used HTML entities in a more colloquial Indian English style:

1.(Non-Breaking Space): This one is like a space that doesn't break. It's used to create extra space 
between words or elements in HTML without letting the browser collapse it into a single space.

2.(Less Than): This entity represents the less-than symbol ("<"). It's handy when you want to show the
 symbol itself in your web content without confusing the HTML parser.

3. (Greater Than): Similar to the previous one, this entity stands for the greater-than symbol (">").
 It ensures the browser displays it as ">", not as the start of a tag.

4.(Ampersand): It's the entity for the ampersand symbol ("&"). You use it when you want to display an
 ampersand without it being mistaken for the start of an HTML entity.

5.(Copyright Symbol): If you want to show the copyright symbol (Â©) on your webpage, you can use this entity
 to make it look professional and legal.
