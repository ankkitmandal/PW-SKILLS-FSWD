Improving the accessibility of HTML is essential for creating a web that's inclusive and usable by a wide range of
people. Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility in a more colloquial Indian English style:

1.Use Semantic HTML Tags: Instead of generic tags, use semantic HTML tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>
 to structure your content. These tags give a clear indication of the content's purpose and help assistive 
 technologies understand the page better.

2.Provide Alternative Text for Images: When adding images, include descriptive "alt" attributes. These alt attributes
 provide text descriptions of the images, making them accessible to screen readers and helping visually impaired 
 users understand the content.

3.Ensure Keyboard Navigation: Make sure your website can be easily navigated using only the keyboard. Test your site's
 functionality without a mouse to ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard shortcuts, 
 helping users with motor impairments.
