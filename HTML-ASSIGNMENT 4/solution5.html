            <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduces semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; that provide a more structured way to define the content and its meaning. These elements enhance accessibility and improve SEO by making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand your content.</p>

            <h2>Video and Audio Support</h2>
            <p>HTML5 offers native support for embedding video and audio content with the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash, making it easier to share multimedia content and improving the user experience.</p>

            <h2>Canvas for Graphics</h2>
            <p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element in HTML5 enables the creation of 2D and 3D graphics directly within the browser. This feature is particularly useful for building interactive applications, games, and visually appealing web content, enhancing the interactivity and engagement of web users.</p>
