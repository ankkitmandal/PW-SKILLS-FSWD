    <p>Hey there, I'm Ankkit Mandal, a BCA student at Manipal University Jaipur, and I'm thrilled to share 
        my exciting journey with you all! <br>📚As I gear up to move into the second year of my studies, I can't help but reflect on the incredible 
        experiences I've had so far. One of the most thrilling aspects of my life right now is my venture into the world of web development. <br>
        💻Why web development, you ask? Well, there's something incredibly satisfying about building and 
        creating from scratch. It's like a playground for my creativity and problem-solving skills. 
        With every line of code, I'm turning my ideas into tangible, functional websites. 
        Whether it's designing a sleek user interface or crafting the perfect user experience, 
        web development has become my creative outlet.But that's not all! <br>🌐 I've also delved into the world of day trading. The stock market is a dynamic, 
        ever-changing arena where I get to apply my analytical skills and instincts. 
        It's a rollercoaster of highs and lows, but the thrill of making informed decisions and watching my investments grow is truly exhilarating. <br>
        💹In many ways, both web development and day trading share a common thread - the pursuit 
        of building something significant. Just as I craft websites from code, I'm crafting my financial future through strategic trading decisions.
        So, whether I'm coding a website or analyzing stock charts, I'm constantly learning, growing, 
        and challenging myself. Life as a BCA student has taken on a whole new dimension as I explore
         these exciting domains.
    </p>
