    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses
         front-end development (user interface and user experience), back-end development (server-side 
         logic and databases), and the integration of various technologies. Key technologies include HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React, Angular, or Node.js. Security, performance 
          optimization, and responsive design are essential considerations. Web developers often work in
           agile teams, collaborate on projects, and use version control systems like Git. Continuous 
           learning is crucial in this dynamic field to stay updated with evolving technologies and trends.</p>
