    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web design focuses on creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
        It combines elements of graphic design, layout, and user experience to craft
        engaging digital interfaces. Web designers use tools like Adobe XD, Sketch,
        or Figma to create wireframes and prototypes, and they work closely with web
        developers to turn designs into functional websites. Key considerations include
        color schemes, typography, layout, and responsive design to ensure a seamless
        user experience across devices. Effective web design enhances a website's 
        aesthetics, usability, and overall effectiveness in conveying information 
        or facilitating interactions.
