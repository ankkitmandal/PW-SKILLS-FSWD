A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon or image associated with a website or web page. It appears in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other places to visually represent the website and help users identify it.

Here's an illustrative example of how to define a favicon in the HTML of a webpage:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    
</body>
</html>
